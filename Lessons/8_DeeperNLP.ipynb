We could try treating individual characters as tokens, or [regard entire sentences as our tokens](https://claritynlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/algorithms/sentence_tokenization.html), but a common mid-point is to use *words* as tokens.  \n",

So we may wish to regard related words such as \"jump\", \"jumping\", \"jumps\",... as variations on the *stem* of \"jump\".  We may hang on to the endings such as \"-ing\" for later use, regarding them as additional tokens. The process of *stemming* or \"*stemmification*\" is the breaking up of words into their stems and hanging on to endings (or not).  Also, what about compound words?  Some languages such as German will make very long single words (e.g. Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung for \"speed limit\") that in other languages would be considered as separate words. If language translation is our goal, some way of tokenizing that includes such variability would be important.  Also, what about punctuation? To keep things simple, we could just delete all forms of punctuation -- or expand contractions like \"I'll\" to \"I will\", and so forth -- and yet if we want a highly accurate model we may find that holding on to some forms of punctuation will important.\n",

Expressing these frequencies as fractions of the total number of words, we could then assign to each word its pair of \"positive use\" and \"negative use\" frequency values $(f_p, f_n)$ which lie in the two-dimensional [unit square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_square) (shown below). These would then form the coordinates for a *word vector* of our word in its *embedding* space (i.e., the unit square in this case).  Then to classify a post, we could just take the sum of the word vectors of all the words in the post and see whether the result is more \"positive\" than \"negative\".
