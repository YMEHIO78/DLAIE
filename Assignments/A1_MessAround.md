# Assignment 1: "Mess Around"

*(This is to be done over the first weekend of class, i.e. Friday to Monday.)* 


## The playground(s):

The following websites have (typically several different) Deep Learning demos that will run in your (desktop or laptop) browser. 

* [Tensorflow.js Demos](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos)
* [ML4A (ML for Arists) Demos](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/)
* [Google PAIR's Explorables](https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/), [Google Magenta's Music Demos](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos/), [Google QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/), [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
* [Gradio.app](https://gradio.app/) hosts lots of demos.  For basics, just scroll down. For advanced examples see [Gradio Hub](https://gradio.app/hub).
* [Object Detector](https://hedges.belmont.edu/objdet/) (On Hawley's web page)

* [ConvNet.js](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) by Karpathy (now head of Tesla AI)
* [Interactive ML Experiments](https://trekhleb.dev/machine-learning-experiments/#/)
* [TensorFire](https://tenso.rs/)
* More Research-Oriented:
  * [Polo Club](https://poloclub.github.io/) at Georgia Tech (scroll down).
  * Hugging Face ðŸ¤— demos: [Write With Transformer](https://transformer.huggingface.co/), [HTML for NLP](https://huggingface.co/hmtl/), [NeuralCoref](https://huggingface.co/coref/)
  * [Distil.pub](https://distill.pub/), interactive research reviews
* VQGAN+CLIP (text->art), via [Colab](https://sourceful.us/doc/935/introduction-to-vqganclip) or [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/VQGAN_CLIP)
* DLOlogy ["Top 10 DL Demos to Run in Your Browser"](https://www.dlology.com/blog/top-10-deep-learning-experiences-run-on-your-browser/)
* [Open-Unmix Audio (Source Separation) Demo](https://open.unmix.app)


## Your task:

Over the weekend, pick any two demos from any site(s) and "mess around," i.e., explore them. For example...

* Try giving them different kinds of inputs. 

* Try to "break" them, give them crazy inputs.  

* Observe how the model's behavior is similar to and/or different to what a human might do. 
* Observe how societal biases might enter in to the model's results. 

Find something that interests you, that's fun or intriguing for you to explore. **You should spend roughly an hour investigating two demos, but feel free to spend more time** if you get hooked! 

* Then there will be two more things for you to do:


## Assessment:

1. Write a paragraph each (~150-200 words) each on each thing you tried. Tell us what it was, what you liked or didn't like, how well it worked, and any future applications you imagine for this technology. Upload this writing on Blackboard before class on Monday. 

2. On Monday, we will meet for class and share verbally with the class what we did and what we learned. Come prepared to speak! 



## P.S.:

...Think of this assignment as partly just having fun, and also partly #6 above. ;-)
