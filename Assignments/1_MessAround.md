# Assignment 1: "Mess Around"

*(This is to be done over the first weekend of class, i.e. Friday to Monday).* 


## The playground(s):

The following websites have (typically several different) Deep Learning demos that will run in your (desktop or laptop) browser. 

* [Tensorflow.js Demos](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos)
* [ML4A (ML for Arists) Demos](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/)
* [Google PAIR's Explorables](https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/)
* [Object Detector](https://hedges.belmont.edu/objdet/) (Hawley's web page)
* [Gradio.app](https://gradio.app/).  For for basics, just scroll down. For advanced examples see [Gradio Hub](https://gradio.app/hub).
* [ConvNet.js](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) by Karpathy (now head of Tesla AI)
* [Interactive ML Experiments](https://trekhleb.dev/machine-learning-experiments/#/)
* [TensorFire](https://tenso.rs/)
* More Research-Oriented:
  * [Polo Club](https://poloclub.github.io/) at Georgia Tech (scroll down). More research-oriented projects
  * Hugging Face ðŸ¤— demos: [Write With Transformer](https://transformer.huggingface.co/), [HTML for NLP](https://huggingface.co/hmtl/), [NeuralCoref](https://huggingface.co/coref/)
  * [Distil.pub](https://distill.pub/), interactive research reviews
* VQGAN+CLIP (text->art), via [Colab] or [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/VQGAN_CLIP)



## Your task:

Over the weekend, pick any two demos and "mess around," i.e., explore them. For example...

* Try giving them different kinds of inputs. 

* Try to "break" them, give them crazy inputs.  

* Observe how the model's behavior is similar to and/or different to what a human might do. 
* Observe how societal biases might enter in to the model's results. 

Find something that interests you, that's fun or intriguing for you to explore. **You should spend roughly an hour investigating two demos, but feel free to spend more time** if you get hooked! 



## Assessment:

On Monday, we will "gather" synchronously online for class and share verbally with the class what we did and what we learned. Come prepared to speak! 



## P.S.:

...Think of this assignment as partly just having fun, and also partly #6 above. ;-)
